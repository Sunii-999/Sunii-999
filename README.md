## 💼 Who am I?
I'm a full stack developer who enjoys coding projects that have a personal meaning or software that can help someone. I use tools like **React.js** / **Next.js** to build smooth and user-friendly digital experiences. I also freelance as a developer and graphic designer.

When I’m not at the computer, you’ll probably find me gaming, enjoying a movie marathon, or getting lost in a good book. Whether it’s pixels or code, I love crafting things that make people smile.
